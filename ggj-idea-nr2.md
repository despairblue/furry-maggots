* 2 player
* multi-color flashlights
* complete darkness
* 2D platformer-puzzle
* some walls have colors -> u can go through those walls by change the light of the scene to its color (it visually and in this world also physically vanishes)
* later in the game we might have platforms that are ony visible when lit with specifz light
* enemies with color, that can be destroyed by hitting them with corresponding colored light
* there are kind of light switches that are used to save the game (all previous content is now properly lit)
* there are some kind of light bulbs (those could also move) -> one changes its color by illuminating it with the flashlight/s
* plot: all light is gone. What do we do now? utopic but okay..
* add time component to limit clear time of levels? Could also provide levels of difficulty
* different colors generate different tunes (so we have dynamic soundtrack) -> also mixing colors mixes tunes -> cedric?

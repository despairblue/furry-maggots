## Blackout Menace

Imagine a complete blackout in an underground facility which a civilization called it's home for centuries now. The world turned pitch black. 
What do we do now is the question everyone is asking? 
Two brave players set out on a quest to return light to their world. Equipped only with a kid's multicolored flashlight they advance from level to level by solving color theory themed puzzles together in cooperation.

### Info 
The uploaded game is more or less a prove of concept. We hadn't had the time to create a level. The Flashlights are point lights instead of cones. That is due to us not implementing the flashlights properly by now. 

### Keywords 
2 player, 2D side-scrolling puzzle platformer, color theory, additive color mixing
